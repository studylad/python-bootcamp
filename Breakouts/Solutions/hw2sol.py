This is a solution to the Homework #2 of the Python Bootcamp

The basic idea is to create a simulation of the games Chutes and Ladders, 
to gain some insight into how the game works and, more importantly,
to exercise new-found skills in object oriented programming within Python.

The setup for the homework is given here:
